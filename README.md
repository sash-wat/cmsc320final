# CMSC320 Final Tutorial - Do Award Winners Deserve Their Awards?

In most professional sports leagues, a variety of awards are typically given to a player or players following the conclusion of the season to recognize them for their outstanding play.
These awards typically include recognition for being a league's Most Valuable Player, as well as recognition for offensive and defensive performances.

These players are typically from the best teams, and there is often controversy and discussion around whether or not a particular player was truly deserving of their award.

This final tutorial aims to answer three questions:

1. Given statistics from previous award winnerss, can we accurately predict the same award winner of any given season?
2. Given a set of statistics, can we predict if a hypothetical player would have won a particular in any given season?
3. Are award winners typically statistical outliers based on individual statistics, or does the success of their team play a significant role in award worthiness?

## Future Plan

1. Contextualize MVP and DPOY seasons
    1. Standardize variables by season, show how much of an outlier MVPs and DPOYs are in relevant statistics
2. Understand what statistics are most likely to contribute to MVP
    1. Does team W/L play a significant role or can sheer statistical greatness overcome poor team play?
